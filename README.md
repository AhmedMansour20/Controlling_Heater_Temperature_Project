# Controlling_Heater_Temperature_Project
##Describtion: 
	* User can monitor system temperature and can set the maximam 
	  temperature that the system can reach. 
	* Heater will shutdown when reach to heater absolute maximum 
	  temperature(supposed to be 100 cel.degree) to protect it 
	  from damaging.
##Tools:
   The project controls a heater tempertature based on Atmega32APU 
   microcontroller, the poject components are:
   1- Atmega32APU.
     * ADC module.
	   * WDT module.
	   * GPIO ports.
   2- LCD(2*16).
   3- Keypad(4*4).
   4- Temperature sensor (LM35).
   5- Two leds.
   6- Buzzer.
